OptimiZation

This is a playground for learning and playing with optimization algorithms. The various algorithms used include:

    aco: Ant Colony Optimization
    bat: Bat algorithm
    smo: Spider Monkey Optimization
    bee: Artificial Bee Colony
    fpa:  Flower Pollination Algorithm
    cmea: Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm
    geneprog: Genetic Programming
    genefeat: Genetic Algorithm
    gravity: Gravity Search Algorithm
