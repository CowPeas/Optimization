This is my playground for optimization algorithms. The various algorithms used include:
ACO: Ant Colony Optimization
SMO: Spider Monkey Optimization
geneprog: Genetic Programming
genefeat: Genetic Algorithm
cmea: Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm
gravity: Gravity Search Algorithm
fpa:  Flower Pollination Algorithm
bat: Bat algorithm

<p style={"text:red"}>The above algorithms were tested on the iris data-set for feature selection.</p>
